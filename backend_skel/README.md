# Backend (Laravel API) Skeleton

This folder contains Laravel-oriented files for the new B-Audio backend.

> Note: This is **not** a full Laravel installation. On a machine with PHP &
> Composer you should create a Laravel project here and then merge these
> `app/`, `database/` and `routes/` files into it.

## 1. Bootstrapping Laravel

On your dev machine:

```bash
cd backend
composer create-project laravel/laravel .
```

Then merge/keep the following from this repo:

- `app/Models/Category.php`
- `app/Models/Product.php`
- `app/Models/Review.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/*.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_11_20_*_create_*_table.php`
- `routes/api.php` (merge with the one generated by Laravel)
- `docs/api-contract.md`

Run migrations once env is configured:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## 2. API Overview

Routes are defined in `routes/api.php` and follow the contract in
`docs/api-contract.md`:

- `GET /api/products` – paginated product list with filters & sorting.
- `GET /api/products/{slug}` – product detail + `top_reviews`.
- `GET /api/categories` – list categories with `product_count`.
- `GET /api/products/{slug}/reviews` – list reviews for product.
- `POST /api/products/{slug}/reviews` – create review and update aggregates.

Once Laravel is installed and env configured, hitting these endpoints should
produce JSON that matches the shared contract used by the Next.js web and
React Native mobile clients.
